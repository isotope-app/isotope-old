Room creation process:
The user inputs an desired name for the chatroom, and then the system will
hash it and use the digest to create a ipfs pubsub channel.

Encryption/decription process:
when someone joins a chatroom, the server fetches that user's public key
on a keyserver, such as https://keys.openpgp.org/ and when someone sends a message,
the system first signs the message using the sender's private key, and then
encrypts the user's message using everyone's public key, generating a different message
for everyone, and sends it to everyone in the room.
After that, everyone in the chat room can decrypt the system using their own private key, and
verify the sender by using the sender's public key to verify the message is signed.
